## BSpline 2D or 3D an old project from 2009 update 2012

Enables the construction of splines in 2D or 3D space using (n) number of control points.
The repo also include a test MFC application for draw spline in 2D. However,
the "BSpline" code is designed to work in both 2D or 3D (if you provide values for the Z axis the curve will smoothly deform along (x,y,x) vectors).

### MFC test application:
- Visual Studio Community 2019 - MFC Installation components only required to use test application.
  - C++ MFC for v141 build tools (x86, & x64) or
  - C++ MFC for v142 build tools (x86, & x64)
 
 ### [BSpline code](https://github.com/cjpdev/BSpline/tree/main/BSpline)
 * The actual BSpline code should compile with any C++ compiler.
